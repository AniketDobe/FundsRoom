**In this React App I have only design frontend for the zomato.**

The feature of my project is photo verification.
Using the photo verification feature the system increases its transparency and make it reliable.
I have created only the restaurant side page means the photos will clicked by the restaurant cooked and will be uploaded for verification purpose.
Once the verification is done then it is good to go for delivery.

**Note: We have to add the quality assurance team or AI for verification of the photos.**
